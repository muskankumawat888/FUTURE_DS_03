# FUTURE_DS_03

I'm excited to share the completion of my first project during the internship: Analyzing Social Media Trends Across Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter!

In this project, I worked with 700+ social media posts to uncover trending topics and analyze public sentiment using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and data visualization tools.

ðŸ“Š Key Features of My Dashboard:
- Sentiment distribution across platforms
- Monthly Post Counts
- Hashtag usage by platform
- Trend lines tracking engagement shifts over time
- User Engagement by Platform
